"""Pre-configured environments: hand-curated tool surfaces whose enums,
bounds, and descriptions map cleanly onto Needle's constrained decoding.
Each module ships TOOLS, SYSTEM, a ready agent, and a frozen acceptance
suite runnable as `python -m needle.environments.<name>`.

    from needle.environments import smart_home

    smart_home.agent.complete("dim the study lights to 30 percent")
    smart_home.run_tests()

To adapt an environment to your product, swap the Literal values (rooms,
contacts, categories) for your own and keep the shapes: closed sets as
enums, bounded numbers, verbatim copy for free text, five tools or fewer.
